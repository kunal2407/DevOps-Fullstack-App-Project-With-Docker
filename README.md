# Step by step explaination

## Getting started

Created in 2-tier Architecture in AWS:
1st EC2 instance : for frontend(Ubuntu)
2nd EC2 instance : for backend/sql(Ubuntu)

Created Security Group and add [5432],[8080],[3000] port at inbound rules.

# Login into Frontend Instance:

Update your instance:
```shell
sudo apt update
```
Installing Node.js to run React.js:
```shell
sudo apt install -y nodejs npm
sudo npm install -g n  #using nodepackagemanager you have installed a Node.js version manager that allows you to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on your system.
sudo n 14.17.0   #This command uses the n package installed in the previous step to install a specific version of Node.js (in this case, version 14.17.0).
node -v
```
n is a Node.js version manager. It allows you to easily install, manage, and switch between multiple versions of Node.js on your system. With n, you can install different versions of Node.js side by side and quickly switch between them as needed for your projects or development environments.
Clone git repo:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Shantanu20000/DevOps-Fullstack-App-Project-With-Docker.git
```
Go to frontend dir after all this installation and run npm start
```shell
cd DevOps-Fullstack-App-Project-With-Docker/frontend/
```
# # Mention Backend Public Ip In .env file 
```
sudo vim .env # REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://localhost:8080/employees --> REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://backend_pub_ip:8080/employees
```
# Install npm Packages and Start npm
```
npm install #This command is used to install dependencies listed in the package.json file of a Node.js project.
npm start   #This command is typically used to start the application defined in the scripts section of the package.json file
```

# Login into Backend Instance:

Update your instance:
```shell
sudo apt update
```
Install Postgressql:
```shell
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib
```
Login into Postgressql:
```shell
sudo -i -u postgres  #Switch to the postgres OS User
```
```
PGPASSWORD=12345678 psql -h database-1.cj026e22o5gx.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com -U postgres -d postgres -p 5432
```
After login create DB and User and grant permission to user into Postgressql:
Here, DB_USER=test DB_PASSWORD='1234' DB_NAME=employees 
```shell
CREATE DATABASE employees;
CREATE USER test WITH PASSWORD '1234';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE employees TO test;

\c employees
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO test;
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO test;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO test;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON ALL SEQUENCES IN SCHEMA public TO test;
